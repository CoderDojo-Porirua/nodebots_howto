# Nodebots 101
So you've heard about Nodebots and have decided you want to run your own event (or you have had an event thrust upon you), but you don't have the faintest idea where to start. Fear not - Nodebots Wgtn is here to help. This repo contains a series of non-technical resources for helping you plan, check and run a Nodebots event without worrying that you've forgotten something.
As we progress we will also try and build this into some form of curriculum too (but baby steps!).
Comments, edits and criticisms are all welcome.

##Pre-event Preparation

* Get your event listed on [Nodebots.io](http://nodebots.io/).
* Get RSVPs for your event using Google forms or Eventbrite.
* Decide your audience and then your content.
* Figure out what kit you need.
* Sort out a venue and a team to help out for the day.
* Decide if you are going to provide computers if if attendees are expected to bring their own. (N.B. whilst the former is more work for you it allows you to test everything prior to the day. If you choose the latter be prepared to spend at least a couple of hours troubleshooting the installation of Node.js, Johnny 5 and possible the Arduino IDE on people's computers. You can make this easier in yourself by only offering support for a single type of operating system.)

###Venue Checklist
- [] Powerpoints, extension cords, multiboards to powering computers
- [] On-site computers or attendee laptops
- [] Is wireless network activity required?
- [] Is wireless internet connectivity required?

###Technology Prerequisites
- [] Node.js installed
- [] Johnny-Five installed
- [] Do your arduinos have StandardFirmata running on them?
- [] Do your attendees know how to acess a terminal or command line?
- [] Do your attendees know how to create a script and run it from the command line?
- [] Do you have a hardcopy of the examples in case your internet dies on the day (yes it happens)?

###Helper Checklist
- [] Have you got a list of all your helpers, plus their emaill addresses and cellphone numbers and have your shared it with all of them?
- [] Are your helpers aware of what to do in an emergency situation; fire, earthquake, evacuation etc.
- [] If your helpers are going help with technical support, have they got previous experience with Nodebots or will you run a training session for them?

###Equipment List
- [] Plentiful supply of AA batteries.
- [] Ensure you have at least one working Nodebot model to show off. It helps keen people's attention and interest if they get stuck.
